# Contemporary Issues In Data

This assignment will include my response to two different articles on data-related issues.

## Deep0Tag Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Zero-shot Image Tagging

In traditional machine learning, computers learn via datasets; it's unable to determine and label objects without prior data. This [paper](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/papers/TMM19.pdf) describes the first framework for machine learning without corresponding datasets. Machines are able to label things they have never seen before. It's interesting because it's a huge step into actual artificial intelligence where machines can learn and utilize that knowledge for further application.

## Epidemiological Modeling of Online Social Network Dynamics

In this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259783329_Epidemiological_modeling_of_online_social_network_dynamics), it utilized epidemiological models to explain user adoption and abandonment of online social networks. It predicted that by now, Facebook would have no users: the study was wrong. As of now, Facebook stills holds 2.8 billions users. The biggest issue with this study was that it only used Google search data to predict. However, most Facebook users don't access Facebook via Google; they directly access Facebook through the URL. The main takeaway from this article is that data is oftentimes misleading. When conducting studies, it's important to take into account multiple factors and not just draw data from one source.
